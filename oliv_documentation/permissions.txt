																OLIV Permissions
																----------------


OLIV uses a UNIX/Linux type permission system for access control. The permission
is defined by adding attributes to a node:

		<nodeName owner="ownerName" group="groupName" access="permissions" />


User and groups
---------------
The user permissions are organized in the access.xml file in the session root
directory. In the session.xml the

    <OLIV_ACCESS_FILE> .... </OLIV_ACCESS_FILE>

parameter defines the file, which is used. It can be defined as:

	global ... The access.xml in the oliv root directory is loaded
	local ... The access.xml in the session root directory is loaded


Permissions
-----------
	The permissions are defined with three attributes:

		owner ... the owner of the data
		group ... the group the data is part of
		access ... the access rights for the owner, the group and everybody

	For permission control the access attribute has to be defined as minimum. In
	this case only the permissions for everybody can be controlled.

	The owner definition is the username of the user that created the data.

	The access holds three octal values for:
				O=the owner - G=the group - A=All.

	The bits of the three octal values define:
				bit 0: call links
				bit 1: write
				bit 2: read

	So the value 777 gives all right to everybody. 754 gives full rights to the
	owner, read and link rights to the group and only read permission to all
	other.


access.xml
----------
The access permission definition has two sections for users and groups. In the
user section, each user has one line with the following attributes:


	<user>
		<gast password='md5(password)' full='Gast'/>
		<userName password="md5(password)" full="full name" email="mail address">
	</user>

In the group section, each group has a <name> node for a translated description.
Inside the <users> node is a user id list.

In the translator group the users can have a lang-attribute, for which language
updates they are included. If the user has multiple languages, the node has to
be repeated with the different lang codes:

	<translator>
  	<name>
  		<text lang="de">Ãœbersetzer</text>
  		<text lang="en">Translator</text>
  	</name>

		<users>
			<userName lang="de"/>
			<userName lang="en"/>
		</users>
	</translator>


Permission support
------------------
Permissions are supported in the following areas:

Article module
--------------
	In article content.xml a <access/> tag with the corresponding permissions
	can be added to the root level.

	effect:
	-------
		read ... If no read permission, an empty dummy template is inserted
						 during the preprocessor and nothing is displayed.
		write ... When write permission, the textPlugin connects all fields to the
						  editor.

	Each paragraph can also contain permissions, which are only active on the
	single paragraph. The article wide permission overrides the local permissions.
