	The plugin scans the content xml for nodes with href-attributes. For the url
	different types of strings can be defined:

	- extern url
			If a http:, https: or mailto: string is found, the url is interpreted as
			extern url and kept unchanched.

	- defined methods
			Two methods are defined to use system urls:

			* current()
					The current method uses the page id of the current page and extends it
					with the language and val values.
			* referer()
					The referer method inserts the url refering to the calling page.

	- javascript
			The javascript directive is used to insert a valid javascript url. The
			directive has to be of the format:
									javascript:scriptname(scriptargs)


	- intern page id
			If none of the other methods are executed, the string is interpreted as
			internal page id and extended with the lang and val values. If no page is
			found, the oliv_index_page is used.
