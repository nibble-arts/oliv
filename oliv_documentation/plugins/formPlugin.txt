	The method can handle two tags:

	- form tag
			If no action parameter is defined, it is set to the current page in the
			current language. In the case, a action value is found, the value is
			parsed for a valid page id and extended if found.	The accept-charset is
			set to utf-8.

	-input tag
		* If a $value is found in the value attribute of an input tag, the
			argv::$value() is inserted instead. The $value has to be named after the
			name value.
			 					<input type="text" name="surname" value="$surname"/>
			In this case the argument of the page call in inserted in the input
			field.

		* If the types 'radio' od 'checkbox' are found, the argv::$name() of the
			page arguments are compared with the radio/checkbox tags. In case of
			equality the 'checkbox' attribute is set.
