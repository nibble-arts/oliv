																		Modules
																		-------


Modules are called during the preprocessor sequenze. It is created by calling
the __constructor function. All action done by the module must be started in the
constructor.

The contructor gets a simpleXmlElement as paramter, holding the header
structure:

SimpleXMLElement Object
(
    [name] => name of the module
    [access] => access rights for deinstallation (system can't be uninstalled)
    [version] => version of the module
    [author] => author of the module
    [copyright] => creation date of the module
    [content] => content subdirectory (normally: "content/")
    [template] => template subdirectory (normally: "template/")
    							(The / behind the directory name is mandatory)

    [default_language] => default language of the module texts
    [script] => SimpleXMLElement Object
        (
            [main] => file name of the script (i.e. module_name.php)
        )

									(The nodes are the given parameters when called in the
									content XML. The format for giving the parameter is:
										name:value;...
									i.e.
										template:header;content:header_oliv
									The values are the filenames of the content.xml and
									template.xslt files. The extensions must not be given)
    [param] => SimpleXMLElement Object
        (
            [template] => header
            [content] => header_oliv
        )

    [path] => The path to the module root (i.e. "module/article/")
)

The module class must extend OLIVModule, which provides the template and
content methods used by the preprocessor to include the parsed content to the
page structure and stylesheet.

Creating a module
-----------------

The simplest module offers a content.xml and a template.xslt to be included
in the render process. The OLIVModule class proviedes two static methods:

			simpleXmlElement OLIVModule::load_content($header)
			string OLIVModule::load_template($header)
			
load_template:
	returns the path to the xslt-stylesheet to be included by the preprocessor.
	
load_content:
	returns a simpleXmlElement with the loaded content.

To both methods the method header is given as parameter.
