																		Modules
																		-------


Modules are called during the preprocessor sequenze. It is created by calling
the __constructor function. All action done by the module must be started in the
constructor.

The contructor gets a simpleXmlElement as paramter, holding the header
structure:

SimpleXMLElement Object
(
    [name] => name of the module
    [access] => access rights for deinstallation (system can't be uninstalled)
    [version] => version of the module
    [author] => author of the module
    [copyright] => creation date of the module
    [content] => content subdirectory (normally: "content/")
    [template] => template subdirectory (normally: "template/")
    							(The / behind the directory name is mandatory)

    [default_language] => default language of the module texts
    [script] => SimpleXMLElement Object
        (
            [main] => file name of the script (i.e. module_name.php)
        )

									(The nodes are the given parameters when called in the
									content XML. The format for giving the parameter is:
										name:value;...
									i.e.
										template:header;content:header_oliv
									The values are the filenames of the content.xml and
									template.xslt files. The extensions must not be given)
    [param] => SimpleXMLElement Object
        (
            [template] => templateName
            [content] => contentName
            [javascript] => javascriptName
        )

    [path] => The path to the module root (i.e. "module/article/")
)

The module class must extend OLIVModule, which provides the template and
content methods used by the preprocessor to include the parsed content to the
page structure and stylesheet.

Creating a module
-----------------

The simplest module offers a content.xml and a template.xslt to be included
in the render process. The OLIVModule class proviedes some static methods to
access custom data:


string load_template (simpleXmlElement header[,string name])
------------------------------------------------------------
	Returns the path to the xslt-stylesheet to be included by the preprocessor.

	The name of the template to be loaded can be determined by three cases:
	- no name defined
			The default.xslt is loaded

	- The 'template:templateName;' value is given in the call of the module inside
		of the page definition
			The templateName.xslt is loaded

	- The name argument in the method call is defined
			The argument.xslt is loaded

	In all cases, the templates don't exist, the default.xslt is loaded anyway.
	
	
simpleXmlElement load_content (simpleXmlElement header)
-------------------------------------------------------
	Returns a simpleXmlElement with the loaded content.

	The name of the content to be loaded can be determined by two cases:
	- no name defined
			The default.xml is loaded

	- The 'content:contentName;' value is given in the call of the module inside
		of the page definition
			The contentName.xml is loaded


To both methods the method header is given as argument.


simpleXmlElement load_javascript (simpleXmlElement header)
----------------------------------------------------------
	If the javascript path is defined in the module header, the module javascript
	is included. There are two cases, which file is used:

	- In module call of the page definition a 'javascript:scriptName;' value is
		defined:
			The scriptName.js file is used

	- In module call of the page definition only a 'content:contentName'
		definition is found:
			The 'contentName.js' file is used

	- no parameter is given
			The 'default.js' of 'moduleName.js' file is used


simpleXmlElement load_xml (simpleXmlElement header,string path,string name)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Returns a simpleXmlElement of the file to be loaded. The path referres
	relative to the module root. The name is the name of the xml-file to be
	loaded.

	When the xml file is loaded, the 'text' and 'img' tags are parsed to include
	the corresponding source string for editing.
//TODO include the imagesource string
