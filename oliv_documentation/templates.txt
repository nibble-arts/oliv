																OLIV Templates
																--------------


OLIV uses XSLT-Stylesheets for the page design definition and XML-files for the
content definition. When designing Stylesheets, there are some predefined
templates, which can be used to implement OLIV functionality.


article_paragraph
-----------------

call:
		<xsl:call-template name="article_paragraph">
			<xsl:with-param name="node" select="{nodeName}"/>
		</xsl:call-template>


With the call of the article text node, the information used by the editor are
added to the output. These are:

	textsource ... The path and id of the file containing the text paragraph
	owner ... The owner (creator) of the text
	group ... The group of text
	access ... The UNIX/Linux type access permissions for the text

The permissions are defined in the XML-file on the rool level:

	<access owner='owenerName' group='groupName' access='xwr'/>
