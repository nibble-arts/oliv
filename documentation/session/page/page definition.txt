== The page is defined by two elements ==

=== Page definition file ===

The page structure is defined in the 'pagename'.xml file. It contains the used areas of the template, with reference to modules.

With the section <masterpage /> page definitions can be cascaded. It is possible to define a page with the basic elements, used on a certain amount of pages. Including this masterpage makes it possible to use this assembly often from only one reference. Masterpages can be nested as often as you want.

* 'id' in the basic content tag must be the same as the name of the folder.
* 'mod' gives the name of the used module in this area, which is called by the renderer.

Example:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf8'?>

<content id='admin'>
  <masterpage>common</masterpage>
  <oliv_header mod='header' />
  <oliv_content mod='article'>admin</oliv_content>
  <oliv_top mod='menu'>main</oliv_top>
  <oliv_left mod='menu'>admin</oliv_left>
</content>

=== Language file ===

The language files contain the basic informations about the page name and title, used for display and routing. It must countain the elements listed below. Masterpages contain only the ID and can not be target of a link.

Structure:

[PAGE_INDEX]
ID = "name of the folder the page is stored in"
NAME = "Name of the page in the language"
FRIENDLY_NAME = "Name of the page with _ instead of white spaces and no special characters. This is used for display in the url line."
TITLE = "Title of the page, displayed i.e. in the header area."
