															Class OLIVRight
															---------------


The rights method can check the UNIX/Linux type rights of xml objects, with the
owner-group-access definition in the attributes section. Depending on the type
of request, it returns an array or a string with the access licence.

The right system is similar to the one of UNIX/Linux systems, using seperate
right definitions for the owner, the group and all users. For each section the
value means:
			access & 4 				read permission
			access & 2				write permission
			access & 1				execute permission (open links)
