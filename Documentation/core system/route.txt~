															Class OLIVRoute
															---------------


The route class offers the methods to translate the simple page IDs, which are
used in the core system to identify the right page to load, to a friendly url
string. It is using the language definitions of the page, to translate the
friendly url to the currently used language.

The retranslation process uses the same page language informations to get back
the right page ID and open the wanted page. In this parsing process, the global
_argv value is created. The friendly url string is separated in the part, which
aims to the page ID, and the rest, which is used as value parameter for modules
or plugins. The result is stored in the global _argv variable.

class methods
-------------


void public __construct(void)
-----------------------------
The constructor calls the page scan method to get all page information for the
router. Then it starts the route process.


void private route(void)
------------------------
The friendly url string, sent from the webserver, is
analyzed. The part of the virtual path in the friendly url, which aims to a
page ID is extracted as parameter url, the rest of the virtual url path is
extracted as val parameter. The url is now retranslated to the page ID. The
result is inserted in the global array _argv:

			array()
				"url" => pageID,
				"val" => rest of the friendly url string


array public static function decode(string url[,array names])
-------------------------------------------------------------
The method compares the friendly url string with the page ID definitions in
the menu.xml file. The path found in the menu definition is returned as valid
url array with the lang and url entries.

The rest of the friendly url is returned as val entry in the return array. If a
names array is defined, the val parts are assoziated with the parts of the
friendly url rest.

Example:
--------
	friendly url								/en_GB/index/edit/ARTICLE_INDEX003/
	return array								array()
																"lang" => "en_GB"
																"url" => "index"
																"val" => "edit/ARTICLE_INDEX003"

with names = array("action"):

	return array								array()
																"lang" => "en_GB"
																"url" => "index"
																"val" => "ARTICLE_INDEX003"
																"action" => "edit"

with names = array("action","part"):

	return array								array()
																"lang" => "en_GB"
																"url" => "index"
																"val" => ""
																"action" => "edit"
																"part" => "ARTICLE_INDEX003"
