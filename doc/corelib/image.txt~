																	Class OLIVImage
																	---------------


The image class is used to include images in the template or content definition
for the renderer, without the necessarity of knowing the exact path to the
source of the image. It uses the known paths to the system images as well as
the images of the template or module definitions.


path: includes/


class methods:
--------------


string public static _(string image[,string lang])
--------------------------------------------------

The main image script parses the image string and looks for the path the desired
image is stored. It returns the full path/file.extension on success, or FALSE.
If the image directory has a language/ subdirectory, a language dependent
version of the image can be returned. Without the lang parameter, the OLIV_LANG
is used, but can be overloaded by the lang parameter.

The image is searched on the following places and in this order:

	1. the full path is definde -> take what is defined
	2. look in the system image path
	3. look in the template image path
	4. look in the module image path of all loaded modules


string static public img(string image[,string lang])
----------------------------------------------------

Creates an correct html image tag out of an image xml, using different format
options:

	lang					language
	alt						alternative text when the browser don't display images
	width					width of the image
	height				height of the image
	link					make a link
	float					make the image float
	margin				set the overall margin value
	margin_left		
				_right
				_top
				_bottom	set the corresponding margin value
	margin_side		set the margin of the side not at the border


global functions:
-----------------


string img_exists(string path,string image,string lang)
-------------------------------------------------------

Makes a check if the image exists in the defined path. If there is a language
subdirectory found in the path, first a language version of the image is
searched. With no lang parameter, the OLIV_LANG language is used. If no
extension is definied, the valid extensions, loaded from the system
configuration, are tried. In the case of success, the complete
path/file.extension is returned, elsewise FALSE.


string img_lang_exists(string path,string image,string lang)
------------------------------------------------------------

The functions checks, if a language version of the image in the subdirectory
language/ in the path exists and returns the correct path/image.extension.
